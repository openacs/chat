<h3>
II. Introduction</h3>
We have our own chat server because:
<ul>
<li>
We want to allow our users to participate in instant message communications
with other community members.</li>

<li>
We want our system to be integrated.</li>

<li>
We want to use our own internal permissioning system to more securely determine
who can enter, create or delete rooms that would be possible using an external
security system.</li>

<li>
We want something that can be extended and maintained by any OpenACS
programmer, <em>i.e.</em>, with as few external dependencies as
possible.</li>

<li>
Commercial chat servers tend to be expensive to maintain and will require
a separate community data model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
III. Historical Considerations</h3>
Chat applications allow inexpensive and efficient social interactions between
community members spread across the globe.&nbsp; A community can use the
Chat application&nbsp; to allow its members to have an interactive session
with a special guest or a community member through the means of a moderated
chat. A customer support site can use the Chat application to offer instant
responses to its customers regarding its products.
<h3>
IV. Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p style="color: red">
  Note: this section was produced at the time when the chat package
  was first implemented and refers to products that are no longer in
  service.

<h4>
  <!-- <a href="http://www.aim.aol.com/">AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)</a> -->
AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)</h4>
So why can't companies that want to do 1:1 conversations just use AIM?&nbsp;
AOL Instant Messenger works best with some additional software to be installed
on the user's machine. This is free software, is shipped with Netscape
4.x, and is certainly available to AOL service customers. But it is not
universal and you can't be guaranteed that when someone is connecting to
your Web site they have the AIM client.&nbsp; Furthermore, AIM doesn't
has a logging option, thus there is no way for a site to offer a chat transcript
to its members.
<h4>
  <!-- <a href="http://chat.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Chat</a> -->
Yahoo Chat</h4>
Yahoo offers its members a wide range of services including chat. Their
chat supports both HTML and Java applet clients. Unfortunately, their chat
software is proprietary, so companies cannot incorporate their community
model with Yahoo's chat software.
<h4>
  <!-- <a href="http://www.digichat.com/">DigiChat</a> -->
DigiChat</h4>
DigiChat is a standalone Java chat application. It offers a well thought
out chat client interface and also supports moderated chats. However, like
most third party applications, there are no easy means by which Digichat
can be integrated with a site's preexisting user data model.&nbsp; DigiChat
also comes with a heavy price tag, and as such it might not be suitable
for a small communities that need to support chat sessions.
<p>The ArsDigita Java Chat application does not have a pretty client interface,
nor does it support text formatting like Yahoo and Digichat.&nbsp; However,
our Chat application is open source.&nbsp; As such, any competent Java
developer will be able to improve the interface based upon their or their
employer's preferences. Using the ArsDigita Chat application allows site
developers access to a rich community data model which is compatible with
a variety of existing open-source applications.
<h3>
V. Design Tradeoffs</h3>

<h4>
Archive or not?</h4>
We have to drive the entire system design from a publishing decision: are
we interested in seeing archives of chat sessions? If we are, then archiving
into a single table makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can perform a
single SQL query to see everything that a user has contributed. We can
perform a single SQL query to see how a customer service person is doing.
And so on.
<p>A disadvantage of archiving is that it chews up disk space.&nbsp; Imagine
for a moment that your service is the size of America Online, wherein one
million subscribers chat or use AIM every day.&nbsp; Imagine also that
each person types 50 rows of chat/AIM content each of which requires 100
bytes of storage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a scenario would require our table to
grow by 50 million rows and 5 GB each day. After 20 days, we would begin
to bump up against the billion-row table size that data warehouse experts
suggest as a practical limit.
<p>So it seems that on popular public sites we won't be able to store everything
that users type. At the same time, a customer's interaction with a customer
service person, or a special guest chat should be archived.&nbsp; Also,
many sites engage considerably less traffic than does AOL, and these sites
may benefit from being able to log all chat/AIM communications.
<p>The solution we came up with was to provide an option that allows the
creator of a room to decide whether or not to archive the messages.

<h4>
Chat messages are stored in cache</h4>
Since we do not allow a user to view messages prior to his entrance into
the chat room, there is no need for time-consuming Oracle queries to retrieve
messages.&nbsp; Storing messages in the server cache keeps us from being
able to archive all of the messages from the time the server started.&nbsp;
I decided that I would limit the number of messages cached per room.

<h3>
VI. Data Model Discussion</h3>

<h4>
Should chat messages constitute a subtype of acs-object?</h4>
We are not implementing individual permissioning on each chat message.
As a result we can avoid unnecessary complexity of subtyping the chat message
type. Chat messages will have their own table.
<h3>
VII. User Interface</h3>

<h4>
Types of chat we need to support</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Public chat rooms</strong>. These are open to everyone in the
<kbd>users_active</kbd>
view.</li>

<li>
<strong>Private chat rooms</strong>. These are open to people in particular user
parties. We check permissions using permissioning for each room.</li>
</ul>
For either kind of chat room, we should support moderated chat. That is,
in such a scenario a posting doesn't go live until it has been approved
by someone who has the 'chat_room_moderate' privilege in the room.&nbsp;
<p>We want to support one-to-one messages for customer support, so we need
one layer on top of the Chat application to make sure that users can find
an appropriate chat partner. For example, if Bill User says that he needs
support for his Acme widget, the system has to find the least busy authorized
Acme widget support person and start a one-to-one chat session between
Bill and that person.
<p>For public community sites where nothing is being sold or supported,
a publisher might wish to limit the load on the server from all of this
one-to-one chatting.
<h4>
Options for the publisher</h4>
Some options are configurable per-room, e.g.,
<ul>
<li>
Is a room private?</li>

<li>
If so, grant permission to a particular party to enter the room?</li>

<li>
Is a room moderated?</li>

<li>
If so, by whom?</li>

<li>
Should we archive all chat messages in this room?</li>

<li>
Is this room active?</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Options for room administrator</h4>

<ul>
<li>
If this room archives all of its messages, then give a 'create transcript'
option.</li>

<li>
View available transcripts.</li>

<li>
Edit/delete existing transcripts.</li>
</ul>
